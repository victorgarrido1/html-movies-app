## Future Development

The future road map for this application is the following:
* Add accessibility features to this site to make it easy for people with accessibility needs to use the site.
* Add additional descriptive information about the movie when a single movie is selected. Help to give value for the user and any one whom uses this application.
* Refine the UI for more profound details for the user and possibly make more use from the API.
